spells:
  - name: CRUMBLE
    required: 10
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      This spell only works against man-made
      structures such as buildings and walls. The
      spellcaster rapidly speeds up the passing of
      time in a small area of the structure,
      causing it to collapse. This can effectively
      create a doorway-sized hole through any
      wall, which should be indicated on the
      table somehow. The spell can also be used
      to collapse a section of floor beneath a
      figure standing on a level above the
      ground. In this case, the figure about to be
      affected must pass a Will roll versus the
      casting roll, or fall to the next level down
      and taking damage appropriately.
  - name: DECAY
    required: 12
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      The spellcaster selects and attacks a
      target’s weapon, causing it to decay and
      fall apart, rendering it useless for the rest
      of the game. This spell has no effect on
      magic weapons (even those only
      temporarily enchanted).
  - name: FAST ACT
    required: 8
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      The target figure will act first next turn, in
      a special phase before either player’s
      wizard phase. If this spell is cast multiple
      times in the same turn, all figures so
      affected will act in this special phase,
      starting with the last figure to have had
      Fast Act cast upon it, and concluding with
      the first.
  - name: FLEET FEET
    required: 10
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      Target receives +2 Move for the rest of the
      game. Multiple castings of Fleet Feet on
      the same target have no effect.
  - name: PETRIFY
    required: 12
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      The target is temporarily frozen solid and
      may take no actions on its next activation.
      After the next activation, the figure may
      move as normal. The target may attempt
      to resist this spell by succeeding with a
      Will roll versus the casting roll.
  - name: SLOW
    required: 12
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      The target must pass a Will roll or be
      reduced to one action per activation. After
      each activation, the target may attempt
      another Will roll versus the original
      casting roll, in order to shake off the effects
      of the spell. Otherwise, its effects last until
      the end of the game. Multiple castings of
      this spell on the same target have no effect.
  - name: TIME STORE
    required: 14
    target: Self Only
    description:
      The spellcaster captures a fragment of his
      own present to save for future use. To cast
      this spell, the spellcaster must be able to
      take two actions during the turn. He must
      spend the first action casting Time Store. If
      successful, the second action is lost. This
      spellcaster is now considered to have a
      stored ‘extra action’ that he may use in a
      future turn. This action can only be used
      while the spellcaster is taking his normal
      actions for the turn, essentially giving him
      three actions in that turn. A spellcaster
      may only ever have one stored action at
      any time.
  - name: TIME WALK
    required: 18
    target: Self Only
    description:
      The spellcaster is allowed to activate, with
      the usual two actions, for a second time in
      the turn – during the soldier phase. If a
      spellcaster fails to cast this spell, he suffers
      2 damage in addition to any other damage
      for failing to cast the spell. A spellcaster
      cannot cast Time Walk if he is currently
      using Time Store.

    description:
      If this spell is successfully cast, all bow and
      crossbow attacks are -1 for the rest of the
      game. This spell may be cast multiple
      times (and by multiple spellcasters), with

    required: 12
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      The spellcaster chooses an enemy figure
      within 24” and line of sight and hurls a ball
      of destructive elemental energy at it. The
      target, and every figure (including friendly
      ones) within 1.5” and line of sight of the
      target, immediately suffers a +5 shooting
      attack (roll each attack separately). This
      spell may not target an enemy figure that
      is even partially obscured by another
      figure.
  - name: ELEMENTAL BOLT
    required: 12

  - name: ELEMENTAL HAMMER
    required: 10
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      This spell is cast upon a weapon. The next

  - name: ELEMENTAL SHIELD
    required: 10
    target: Self Only
    description:
      The spellcaster forms a floating shield to
      protect himself. This shield absorbs the
      next 3 points of damage against the
      spellcaster from any source. Once 3 points
      have been absorbed the shield vanishes. A
      spellcaster may only have one Elemental
      Shield active at any time.
  - name: SCATTER SHOT
    required: 12
    target: Area Effect
    description:
      The spellcaster may make one +0 attack
      against every enemy figure (either from an
      opposing warband or a creature) within
      12”. This may include enemy figures in
      combat, although the normal rules for
      shooting into combat are followed in this
      case.
  - name: WALL
    required: 10
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      This spell creates an impenetrable 6”-long,
      3”-high wall within 6” of the spellcaster. At
      the end of each following turn, roll a d20 –
      on a 17+ the wall vanishes.

  - name: ANIMATE CONSTRUCT
    required: 8
    target: Out of Game
    description:
      It is assumed that the spellcaster has built
      a construct prior to using this spell to
      animate it. If the spell is successfully cast,
      the construct immediately becomes a
      member of the warband, taking the place
      of a soldier. A spellcaster may declare that
      he is attempting to animate a construct of
      any size (Small, Medium or Large – see
      Chapter 6&#58; Bestiary), but the larger the
      construct, the harder it is to animate, so
      the following modifiers are applied to his
      roll to cast the spell&#58;
      Small -0, Medium -3, Large -6.
  - name: CONTROL CONSTRUCT
    required: 12
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      If successfully cast, the target construct
      must make an immediate Will roll versus
      the casting roll. If the roll fails, the
      spellcaster gains control of the construct
      for the rest of the game. A spellcaster may
      only control one construct at a time.
  - name: EMBED ENCHANTMENT
    required: 12
    target: Out of Game
    description:
      This spell causes any Enchant Armour or
      Enchant Weapon spell that is still active at
      the end of a game, to become permanent,
      and the weapon or armour in question to
      become a magic item. Alternatively, a
      spellcaster may cast either of those spells
      after a game (even though neither are
      usually an Out of Game spell),
      immediately followed by Embed
      Enchantment. If both spells are successful,
      the item becomes permanently enchanted.
  - name: ENCHANT ARMOUR
    required: 8
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      The armour worn by the target now counts
      as magic armour and grants a +1 to Armour
      for the rest of the game. Multiple castings
      of this spell on the same target have no
      effect.
  - name: ENCHANT WEAPON
    required: 8
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      A target weapon is given a temporary
      magic boost by the spellcaster. Melee
      weapons affected by this spell count as
      magic weapons and give their users +1
      Fight for the rest of the game. Bows and
      crossbows targeted by the spell give +1
      Shoot instead, but do not count as magic
      weapons. Multiple castings of this spell on
      the same weapon have no effect.
      Alternatively, the spell can be used to
      enchant one arrow or quarrel. This gives +1
      Shoot and counts as a magic weapon, but
      only for the next shot. A bow or crossbow
      boosted by Enchant Weapon may be used
      to fire arrows or quarrels similarly
      enchanted, and the bonuses stack.
  - name: GRENADE
    required: 10
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      The spellcaster takes an object, commonly
      a simple rock, imbues it with magic energy
      and throws it at his target, whereupon it
      explodes into hundreds of fragments. The
      caster picks a target point within 12”. Every
      figure, including allies, within 1.5” of that
      point immediately suffers a +3 shooting
      attack.
  - name: STRENGTH
    required: 10
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      The target receives +2 Fight for the rest of

  - name: TELEKINESIS
    required: 8
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      The spellcaster may move any currently
      unclaimed treasure within 24” by up to 6”
      in any direction. As long as he can
      maintain line of sight to the treasure, he
      can move it over any terrain or obstacle. If
      the treasure moves out of line of sight, it
      immediately falls straight to the ground.

  - name: BEAUTY
    required: 10
    target: Self Only
    description:
      This spell causes all humans (i.e. anything
      not found in Chapter 6&#58; Bestiary) who look
      at the spellcaster to see a paragon of
      beauty. Anyone wishing to attack the
      spellcaster must first pass a Will roll versus
      the casting roll. Failing this Will roll does
      not cause the would-be attacker to lose an
      action. Any model magically compelled to
      fight the target must also pass a Will roll or
      suffer -1 to its Fight stat.
  - name: FOOL’S GOLD
    required: 8
    target: Out of Game
    description:
      This spell allows the spellcaster to place
      one additional treasure token before the
      start of the game. However, he must also
      secretly note down which of the treasures
      he has placed is the Fool’s Gold. When any
      figure comes into contact with the Fool’s
      Gold, the treasure token immediately
      vanishes and is removed from the game.
  - name: GLOW
    required: 10
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      A brightly glowing light surrounds the
      target figure. For the rest of the game, all
      shooting attacks against this figure are at
      +3. Multiple Glow spells on the same
      target have no effect.
  - name: ILLUSIONARY SOLDIER
    required: 12
    target: Out of Game
    description:
      Causes an illusionary soldier to join the
      warband for the next battle. This soldier
      can be of any type. This soldier cannot pick
      up treasure, nor can it deal damage. If the
      soldier ever suffers damage of any type, it
      is removed. A warband may only have one
      illusionary soldier at any given time.
  - name: INVISIBILITY
    required: 12
    target: Touch
    description:
      The target figure becomes invisible and
      may not be attacked or targeted by spells
      (although he may still be affected by area
      effects, such as the blast radius of a
      Grenade spell). The effects of this spell last
      until the target attacks, casts a spell, or
      picks up an item of treasure. The spell can
      be cast on a figure already carrying
      treasure, rendering both invisible.
  - name: MONSTROUS FORM
    required: 8
    target: Self Only
    description:
      Any figure wishing to move into contact
      with the spellcaster must make an
      immediate Will roll versus the casting roll.
      If failed, the figure sees a hideous creature
      instead of the spellcaster and is too scared
      to attack – he may only make a move that
      takes him further away. A spellcaster may
      not have Beauty and Monstrous Form cast
      at the same time. Undead, constructs, and
      demons are immune to Monstrous Form.
  - name: TELEPORT
    required: 10
    target: Self Only
    description:
      The spellcaster immediately moves to any
      location within line of sight, but may take
      no other action this turn. This spell may
      not be used to enter combat.
  - name: TRANSPOSE
    required: 12
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      This spell switches the position of two
      figures on the board. The two figures being
      transposed must be within 10” of each
      other and both must be within line of sight
      of the spellcaster. The spellcaster may cast
      Transpose to switch himself with another
      figure. If he attempts to transpose an
      enemy figure (either a creature or member
      of a rival warband), they may each make a
      Will roll versus the casting roll. If even one
      succeeds with this Will roll, the spell fails.
      This spell may target figures in combat.

  - name: BONE DART
    required: 8
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      This spell fires a small, sharp shard of bone
      at a target. The spellcaster may make an
      immediate +5 shooting attack against any
      figure in line of sight. This does not count
      as a magic attack.
  - name: BONES OF THE EARTH
    required: 10
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      A skeletal hand reaches out of the ground
      and grabs the target’s ankle. The target is
      held fast and may not move. Any magic
      form of movement will allow the target to
      escape the hand. Otherwise, the only way
      to escape the hand is to fight. The hand
      has Fight +0 and Health 1. If the hand is
      damaged, it vanishes, and the target is free.
      This spell may only be cast against a target
      that is standing on ground level. The
      maximum range for this spell is 18”.
  - name: CONTROL UNDEAD
    required: 12
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      If successfully cast, the target undead
      creature must make an immediate Will roll
      versus the casting roll. If the roll fails, the
      spellcaster gains control of the undead
      creature for the rest of the game. A
      spellcaster may only control one undead
      creature at a time.
  - name: RAISE ZOMBIE
    required: 8
    target: Out of Game OR Touch
    description:
      This spell can be used both ‘Out of Game’
      and during the game. If successful, the
      spellcaster adds one zombie to his
      warband (see Chapter 6&#58; Bestiary). If the
      spell is cast before the game, the zombie
      can be deployed normally. If it is cast
      during a game, the zombie appears in base
      contact with the spellcaster. A warband
      may only have one raised zombie at any
      one time. If the zombie is killed during a
      game, Raise Zombie can be cast again to
      create another. A raised zombie does not
      count towards the warband size limit and
      remains with a warband until the end of
      the game, at which point it crumbles into
      dust.
  - name: REVEAL DEATH
    required: 12
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      This spell causes the target to see a vision
      of his own death. The target must make an
      immediate Will roll versus the casting roll.
      If the target fails, he loses his next
      activation.
  - name: SPELL EATER
    required: 12
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      This spell cancels the effects of any one
      spell currently in play, and the spellcaster
      immediately takes 1 point of damage. It
      cannot unsummon a creature, but it can
      cancel the control of a creature.
  - name: STEAL HEALTH
    required: 10
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      The target must make an immediate Will
      roll versus the casting roll. If failed, the
      target immediately loses 3 Health and the
      spellcaster regains 3 Health. This may not
      take the spellcaster above his starting
      health. This spell has no effect on undead,
      constructs or demons. A spellcaster may
      target a member of his own warband – if
      he does, however, the target will
      immediately (and permanently) leave the
      warband and will move as quickly as
      possible off the board.
  - name: STRIKE DEAD
    required: 18
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      This spell may target a figure within 8”.
      The target must make a Will roll versus the
      casting roll or be immediately reduced to 0
      Health. All figures may empower their Will
      roll to resist this spell, even nonspellcasters.
      The spellcaster immediately
      loses 1 Health upon attempting this spell
      (even if it is cast successfully), plus any
      additional loss incurred by failure or
      empowerment.

    target: Out of Game
    description:
      This spell can only be cast by a wizard, and
      allows him to absorb the knowledge from a
      written work without having to read it. A
      wizard immediately gains 50 experience
      points for casting this spell to represent

      after a game in which the wizard was not
      reduced to 0 Health.
  - name: CREATE GRIMOIRE
    required: 12
    target: Out of Game
    description:
      This spell allows a spellcaster to create a
      grimoire containing one spell that he
      already knows. In order to create a
      grimoire, the spellcaster must first cast
      Create Grimoire, and then the spell he
      wishes to place into the grimoire (even if it
      is not usually an Out of Game spell). If
      both are successfully cast, the grimoire is
      created and the wizard may then sell it.
  - name: DRAINING WORD
    required: 14
    target: Area Effect
    description:
      This spell draws a bright rune of power in
      the sky. The spellcaster may choose one
      spell for the Draining Word to affect. All
      rolls to attempt to cast that particular spell
      are at -3 for the rest of the game. A
      spellcaster may only have one Draining
      Word spell in effect at any given time.
  - name: EXPLOSIVE RUNE
    required: 10
    target: Touch
    description:
      The spellcaster draws a bright, glowing
      rune of power on the ground or a wall. A
      marker should be placed on the table to
      represent the rune. If any character or
      creature that was not part of the
      spellcaster’s warband at the start of the
      game comes within 1” of the rune, it
      explodes, and every figure, friend or foe,
      within 2” suffers an immediate +5 shooting
      attack. A spellcaster may have up to three
      such runes in play at any time. At the end
      of any turn, he may choose to cancel any
      or all of his runes. If the spellcaster is
      removed from play, any runes he placed
      are also removed.
  - name: FURIOUS QUILL
    required: 10
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      The target is attacked by a sharp animated
      quill. Although the quill does no damage,
      it is highly irritating and extremely
      distracting. While under attack, the target
      suffers -1 Move, -2 Fight, -4 Shoot and -2 to
      any casting rolls. At the start of the target’s
      activation each turn, he may make a Will
      roll versus the casting roll – if successful,
      the quill is caught and destroyed. Multiple
      castings of Furious Quill against the same
      target have no effect. This spell may be
      cast against a figure in combat with no
      penalty.
  - name: POWER WORD
    required: 14
    target: Area Effect
    description:
      This spell draws a bright rune of power in
      the sky. The spellcaster may pick one spell
      for the Power Word to affect. All rolls to
      cast that particular spell are at +3 for every
      spellcaster for the rest of the game. Each
      spellcaster may have only one Power Word
      in effect at any given time.
  - name: PUSH
    required: 8
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      The target suffers an immediate +10 attack.
      Instead of taking damage from this attack,
      the target is moved 1” directly away from
      the spellcaster for every point of damage
      he would have taken. If this pushes the
      target into a piece of terrain or the edge of
      the board, he stops immediately. Other
      figures do not stop (or get hit by) a pushed
      figure – they are assumed to step out of the
      way. If the target is pushed off a height, he
      suffers falling damage as normal.
  - name: WRITE SCROLL
    required: 12
    target: Out of Game
    description:
      A spellcaster may attempt to cast this spell
      once after every game. If successful, one

      have no effect, but it may be cast again if
      the original spellcaster is removed from
      play.

    description:

      against the casting roll, he temporarily
      joins the spellcaster’s warband and can be
      activated as normal during the soldier
      phase of the spellcaster’s turn. After each
      activation, the soldier may make a Will roll
      versus the casting roll to shake off the
      spell’s effects. A spellcaster may only have
      one active Mind Control spell at a time.

      treasure, and may be cast immediately
      before a game. If successful, the
      spellcaster’s warband may place one

      as most ruins. Place a token next to the
      terrain feature to represent the Wizard
      Eye. For the rest of the game, the
      spellcaster may choose to draw line of
      sight from the Wizard Eye instead of from
      his figure when casting spells. The Wizard
      Eye has 180-degree field of vision. A
      spellcaster may only maintain one Wizard
      Eye at a time.

  - name: BIND DEMON
    required: 10
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      The target demon must make an
      immediate Will roll versus the casting roll.
      If it fails, the spellcaster gains control of
      the demon for the rest of the game. A
      spellcaster may only have one bound
      demon at a time.
  - name: IMP
    required: 10
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      An imp immediately appears, anywhere
      within the spellcaster’s line of sight, but no
      closer than 3” to another figure. The imp
      follows the normal rules for creatures and
      will act in the next creature phase. If the
      same spellcaster casts this spell a second
      time, the first imp will immediately vanish.
  - name: LEAP
    required: 8
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      The target makes an immediate 10” move
      in any direction, including vertically. This
      move is not hindered by any terrain unless
      that terrain is over 10” high. Target may
      take no other action this turn. This spell
      cannot be used to move a figure into
      combat.
  - name: PLAGUE OF INSECTS
    required: 12
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      The target figure is attacked by a cloud of
      stinging or biting insects that irritate and
      distract. The cloud of insects has a 1” radius
      centred on, and moving with, the target
      figure. It affects all figures, including the
      target figure, fully or partially within this
      radius. While being pestered by the
      insects, a figure has -4 Fight and -4 Shoot.
      The target figure must pass a Will roll
      versus the original casting roll at the start
      of his activation in order to beat off all the
      insects. Other figures within the radius
      may simply move away to escape. A figure
      may only ever be affected by one Plague of
      Insects, whether as a target or by virtue of
      being within the 1” radius.
  - name: PLANAR TEAR
    required: 12
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      The spellcaster creates a small tear in the
      fabric of the universe. This rift is painful to
      humans and creatures, but lethal to
      demons. The spellcaster selects a target
      point. All figures within 2” of that point
      must make a Will roll versus the casting
      roll or suffer 2 points of damage. Demons
      that fail the Will roll take damage equal to
      the casting roll.
  - name: PLANE WALK
    required: 14
    target: Self Only
    description:
      Although the spellcaster remains in the same
      physical location, he briefly moves between
      planes. Until his next activiation, he can
      ignore all terrain when moving, walking
      through walls and across chasms. He may not
      be the target of any shooting attacks or spells.
      The spellcaster will never be considered in
      combat during the turn, nor can he be
      attacked by any figure. However, he also may
      not pick up treasure, or in any way affect
      other characters or terrain on the board. If he
      is carrying treasure, he drops it. It is
      incredibly draining to move between planes
      of existence, so if a spellcaster attempts to
      cast this spell in a second consecutive turn,
      he suffers a -5 modifier. He suffers a -10
      modifier if he attempts it three turns in a row
      and -15 on the fourth turn and beyond.
  - name: POSSESS
    required: 12
    target: Line of Sight
    description:
      This spell may only be cast on a member of
      the spellcaster’s own warband. The target
      is possessed by a demon and gains
      +2 Fight, +2 Armour, and -2 Will for the
      remainder of the battle and counts as a
      demon for all intents and purposes (e.g.
      Banish, Bind Demon). If removed from the
      game for any reason (such as being hit by a
      Banish spell), check for the character’s
      survival as normal. A spellcaster may only
      have one Possess spell active at a time.
  - name: SUMMON DEMON
    required: 12
    target: Touch
    description:
      If successfully cast, a demon is immediately
      placed on the table within 1” of the
      spellcaster. It may not be placed straight into
      combat. The demon is treated as though it is
      already subject to a Bind Demon spell. A
      spellcaster may only have one bound demon
      at a time. The type of demon summoned
      depends on the amount by which the
      spellcaster succeeded on his casting roll&#58; 1–5
      Imp, 6–12 Minor Demon, 13+ Major Demon
      (see Chapter 6&#58; Bestiary). If a spellcaster rolls
      a 1 while attempting to cast this spell, a
      demon is placed on the table and
      immediately attacks the summoner. The type
      of demon is determined using the same chart
      as above, but using the amount by which the
      casting roll was failed.

      The spellcaster summons an animal
      companion of his choice from the
      following options to join his warband&#58;
      Bear, Wolf, Snow Leopard, Ice Toad (see
      Chapter 6&#58; Bestiary). The animal takes the
      place of a soldier for the purposes of
      maximum warband size. Animal
      companions may not collect treasure or
      carry items. They may be controlled by
      another spellcaster using the Control
      Animal spell, although they will re-join
      their original warband after the game.
      Animal companions are more strongwilled
      than wild examples of their species –
      give them +2 to the Will stat found in the
      appropriate Bestiary entry. A spellcaster
      may only have one animal companion at
      any time.
  - name: BREW POTION
    required: 12

      familiar in the form of a small creature of
      his choosing. A spellcaster with a familiar
      gains +2 Health (write as a split stat). If the
      spellcaster is ever reduced to his last point
      of health, the familiar is destroyed. At the
      start of the next game, the spellcaster will
      revert to his normal health, unless another
      Familiar spell is successfully cast. This
      additional health may take a spellcaster
      over his usual maximum for the stat.

      may draw line of sight through it. At

      The spellcaster flings a small dart coated in
      a potent poison. The spellcaster makes an
      immediate +5 shooting attack against any
      figure in line of sight. If the attack beats
      the target’s Armour it causes no damage,
      but he loses one of his two standard
      actions per activation for the rest of the
      game, or until healed by either a Heal spell
      or a Healing Potion. The remaining action
      does not have to be the otherwise
